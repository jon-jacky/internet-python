Exercises and projects for the course, Internet Programming in Python, Winter 2011

Week 3: Work on the assignment is in the mashup directory.

Week 2: The solution to the assignment is in the ws30 directory.
To demonstrate on localhost, start the server from the directory 
above internet_python like this:

 C:\Users\jon\Documents>python internet-python\ws30\thirty_minute_webserver.py

then point a browser on running on the host at this URL:

 http://localhost:8080/internet-python/ws30/print_time.py

Week 1: The solution to the first week's assignment is in the sockets
directory, sum_client.py and sum_server.py.  To run both server and
client on the same machine, use default host 'localhost'

To run the server on the Bluebox VM and the client on my laptop, you
must provide the same VM hostname on the command line on both the
client and the server.  For example, use this command to start the
server on the VM:

 $ python sum_server.py "block115406-urm.blueboxgrid.com"

Use this command to connect to the server from a client on another machine:

 > python sum_client.py block115406-urm.blueboxgrid.com 50000 8 7
