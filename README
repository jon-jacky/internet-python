Exercises and projects for the course, Internet Programming in Python, Winter 2011

The solution to the first week's assignment is in the sockets
directory, sum_client.py and sum_server.py.  They both work on my own
laptop and on the bluebox vm when they both run on the same host,
using host 'localhost'.  However when I run the server on the bluebox
vm I cannot connect from the client running on my own laptop:

socket.error: [Errno 10061] No connection could be made because the
target machine actively refused it

This looks likes a firewall problem I haven't solved yet.
