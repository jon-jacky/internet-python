Exercises and projects for the course, Internet Programming in Python, Winter 2011

Week 4: cgi directory: json_adder.py is a Python CGI program that gets
two arguments from the query string in the URL, adds them, then
reports the results, along with other information, in JSON format.
Invoke the program by:

 http://URL?a=123&b=321 

(or any other two numbers at a and b).  I have tested with URL

localhost/cgi-bin/jason_adder.py 

(with my local Apache server under Windows) and on the VM at

 http://block115406-urm.blueboxgrid.com/cgi-bin/json_adder.py

I have tested the program by 

 python check_assignment.py "URL"

with both of the above URLs

Week 3: mashup directory: use BeautifulSoup to extract links and other
information from

 http://staff.washington.edu/jon/links.html

the use pydelicious (Python API for delicious.com) to store them at

 http://www.delicious.com/jackyj

This project is not finished.

Week 2: The solution to the assignment is in the ws30 directory.
To demonstrate on localhost, start the server from the directory 
above internet_python like this:

 C:\Users\jon\Documents>python internet-python\ws30\thirty_minute_webserver.py

then point a browser on running on the host at this URL:

 http://localhost:8080/internet-python/ws30/print_time.py

Week 1: The solution to the first week's assignment is in the sockets
directory, sum_client.py and sum_server.py.  To run both server and
client on the same machine, use default host 'localhost'

To run the server on the Bluebox VM and the client on my laptop, you
must provide the same VM hostname on the command line on both the
client and the server.  For example, use this command to start the
server on the VM:

 $ python sum_server.py "block115406-urm.blueboxgrid.com"

Use this command to connect to the server from a client on another machine:

 > python sum_client.py block115406-urm.blueboxgrid.com 50000 8 7
