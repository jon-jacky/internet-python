% notes on Brian's Python + Intenet course

16 Jan 2010

At Tully's 4th & Union w/ Brian, Jon Poland, Peter Conerly, Gregg
Toth, new student: Tim Salazar.

Create dropbox account

firstname: Jonathan
lastname: Jacky
email: jon@u.washington.edu
pw: 100153nbj
Computer name: locke

2GB free
Typical setup

https://www.dropbox.com

Puts dropbox notification item on my toolbar, in lrc
So I click on it, it says starting, apparently hangs....

Creates C:\Users\jon\dropbox  with some files and folders

Ok, how do I get the files for the class? What's the folder?

Dropbox help at http://www.dropbox.com/help/16

Now what about setting up a github account, using svn

Github sort of supports svn, but it seems there are limitations.

Just set up github acct on their web page.

https://github.com/signup/free

Username jon-jacky
email jon@u.washington.edu
password 100153nbj

Created public profile

Dashboard is at https://github.com/, help at https://help.github.com/
Nothing about svn on help page.

I installed msysgit months ago - I have git bash shell icon on my toolbar, llc
Open it  - seems to be full-featured bash shell.

I have downloads\git with msysGit-netinstall...exe from 5/13/2010

Brian got me a VM at bluebox, see email today (16 Jan 2010)

username: jon
password: jon@uwe
hostname: block115406-urm.blueboxgrid.com

Use putty to connect, Tully's
Connect to Brian's portable wifi-over-cellphone, name giraffe, pw crazyawesome
Now I can connect to my vm.

Just got Brian's invite to dropbox, accept.

https://www.dropbox.com/home/uwpython#/week1:::28792857

Yes, now I also have C:\Users\jon\dropbox\uwpython\week1 etc.

Back to git ...  follow directions at http://help.github.com/msysgit-key-setup/

I have a ~/.ssh, known_hosts contains seattle.cs.washington.edu and
blackbox.cs.washington.edu

but nothing else - no id_rsa

I didn't select a passphrase, just hit return.

key name is tekkub@gmail.com

Get "successfully authenticated" message.

Okay, I guess I want dirs on VM for various projects, want github repo
to match dirs.   

Next, setting username etc: http://help.github.com/git-email-settings/

In the git bash shell:

jon@LOCKE ~
$ git config --global user.name "jon-jacky"

jon@LOCKE ~
$ git config --global user.email "jon@u.washington.edu"

On github create repository page: https://github.com/repositories/new

Project Name: internet-python

Description: 
Projects for the course, Internet Programming in Python, Winter 2011.

Homepage URL: (left blank)

Who has access? [X] Anyone


It creates repository

git@github.com:jon-jacky/internet-python-.git

What's with the hyphen '-' at the end?  I didn't type this in my repo name!
Argh, there was an extra space at the end. 

Okay, let's delete this and do it over: http://help.github.com/deleting-a-repo/

Yes, now it's: git@github.com:jon-jacky/internet-python.git

Note that there's an option to import an svn repo.

Now make local working directory, mostly following Next steps instructions,
but put it under jon/Documents

jon@LOCKE ~
$ cd Documents/

jon@LOCKE ~/Documents
$ mkdir internet-python

jon@LOCKE ~/Documents
$ cd internet-python

jon@LOCKE ~/Documents/internet-python
$ pwd
/c/Users/jon/Documents/internet-python

jon@LOCKE ~/Documents/internet-python
$ ls

jon@LOCKE ~/Documents/internet-python
$ ls -a
.  ..

jon@LOCKE ~/Documents/internet-python
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in c:/Users/jon/Documents/internet-python/.git/


jon@LOCKE ~/Documents/internet-python (master)
$ touch README

jon@LOCKE ~/Documents/internet-python (master)
$ ls
README

jon@LOCKE ~/Documents/internet-python (master)
$ ls -l
total 0
-rw-r--r--    1 jon      Administ        0 Jan 16 21:06 README

jon@LOCKE ~/Documents/internet-python (master)
$ git add README

jon@LOCKE ~/Documents/internet-python (master)
$ git commit -m "first commit: add internet-python/README"
[master (root-commit) 446ee96] first commit: add internet-python/README

 create mode 100644 README

jon@LOCKE ~/Documents/internet-python (master)
$ git remote add origin git@github.com:jon-jacky/internet-python.git

jon@LOCKE ~/Documents/internet-python (master)
$ git push origin master

 * [new branch]      master -> master

Then click continue on the repository page.  It shows empty README.

Next: edit readme and commit again (or whatever). 

Then, check out repo on VM, Create socket-projects directory.  Begin
to populate it by just copying client and server from dropbox and
running them on VM.

Find tutorials Google: git version control tutorial

https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/GitSvnCrashCourse
https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/GitCheatSheet

This has links to several others, also summary right there on this page

http://help.github.com/git-cheat-sheets/


And man pages (each command linked here)

http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/

So, the basic idea is that the repository is *right there in your
working directory*, in .git - that's a whole (local) repository.  Then
you can create a repository elsewhere with git clone, then push to
another repository or pull from another repository.

git add, git commit etc. apply to the local repository, much like svn.
git clone, git push, git pull apply to another repository.

Look at the commands above - that 

git remote add origin
git push origin master

Oh, master is local repository, origin is upstream repository 

git push, git pull are push to/pull from origin
